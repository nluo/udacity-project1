Udacity frontend web course project 1 - Portfolio

## Quick Reference

To start the development, assume you have npm and gulp install globally, then we could simply do:

```javascript
npm i
gulp
```

This will start a local webserver listening on (http://localhost:8080)[http://localhost:8080] and will watch and re-uglify for any changes in the css file.
